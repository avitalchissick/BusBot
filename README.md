This project utilises a Telegram bot to display data from GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) in Israel.

The bot allows the user to following functions:
1 - Display a list of buses that are planned to go through a specific 
    stop/station using the code written on the stop sign. (/stop command)
2 - Display a list of stops/stations in close range 
    to the location provided by the user. (/location command)
